# Uploading Assets

## How To Upload

The Bundler has two ways to upload files: either click inside the web page or drag and drop into it. The Bundler can also accept multiple file uploads at once which is especially useful for converting Nintendo 3DS assets. The specific types of files that are allowed to be directly uploaded are: zip, TrueType and OpenType fonts, and PNG and JPEG images.

## Converting Assets for Nintendo 3DS

When uploading images and fonts for Nintendo 3DS, the Bundler converts them to formats suitable for the console's hardware. This conversion is necessary because the console does have a limited amount of memory, _far_ less than a desktop computer. Furthermore, please ensure all texture files' dimensions are at minimum 5x5 pixels or at maximum 1024x1024 pixels. This is because the Nintendo 3DS uses power-of-two textures internally, and when textures are loaded, these limits keep the system from failing to load the textures.
