# Overview

The Bundler is a specialized single page application (SPA) web service designed to streamline the process of converting assets for Nintendo 3DS usage or bundling games into a single executable. This service is particularly useful for game developers looking to package their projects efficiently and prepare them for deployment on Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Switch, or Nintendo Wii U consoles.

## Benefits

The Bundler simplifies the previously complex process of converting assets and bundling games. Previously, developers needed to install devkitPro provided tools and libraries, which was not ideal for end-users due to the technical expertise required and the potential for errors. The Bundler eliminates these challenges by offering a user-friendly, web-based interface which is useable by any modern browser. This allows developers to easily upload their game assets and source code, automatically converting and bundling them for their target consoles.
