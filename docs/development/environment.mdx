# Environment Setup

This section provides the necessary steps for configuring a development environment to build and contribute to LÖVE Potion.

In order to start contributing, you will need to [follow the instructions on the devkitPro Wiki](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) for setting up a development environment. If you have an existing pacman installation (e.g. msys2 or Linux) then [refer to this section on the devkitPro Wiki](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman#Customising_Existing_Pacman_Install).

## Dependencies

Once the environment is set up, open your terminal and run the following commands to sync your packages and install the base development groups. On Linux and macOS, prepend `dkp-` to the `pacman` command if `pacman` was installed via the devkitPro installer.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Windows (msys2)">
        ```bash
        pacman -Syu && pacman -S switch-dev 3ds-dev wiiu-dev
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Unix-like (Linux, macOS)">
        ```bash
        sudo (dkp-)pacman -Syu && sudo (dkp-)pacman -S switch-dev 3ds-dev wiiu-dev catnip
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, please [fork and clone the LÖVE Potion repository locally](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). Afterwords, change the working directory to where LÖVE Potion was cloned:

```bash
cd lovepotion
```

Install the required portlibs for whichever console that will be built:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Windows (msys2)">
        ```bash
        pacman -S --needed - < platform/{console}/pkglist.txt
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Unix-like (Linux, macOS)">
        ```bash
        sudo (dkp-)pacman -S --needed - < platform/{console}/pkglist.txt
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After everything has been installed, you can run the `catnip` build command to compile the code for your chosen console.
`catnip` is a build tool provided by devkitPro for managing CMake builds of homebrew. Here are commands for each supported console:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Nintendo 3DS">
        ```bash
        catnip -T 3DS
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Nintendo Wii U">
        ```bash
        catnip -T WiiU
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Nintendo Switch">
        ```bash
        catnip -T Switch
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
