# Debugging

This guide will walk you through the process of identifying and resolving crashes in LÃ–VE Potion using `gdb` (GNU Debugger) and a specialized command-line tool for deeper analysis.

## Setting Up the Debug Environment

To debug crashes, you will need:

- **gdb**: A powerful, open-source debugger.
- **addr2line**: A command-line tool that converts memory addresses into specific lines of code for easier debugging.

devkitPro provides both `gdb` and `addr2line` for both Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch. Install `gdb` with the following, as `addr2line` was already installed when setting up the environment:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Windows (msys2)">
        ```bash
        pacman -S devkitARM-gdb devkitA64-gdb
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Unix-like (Linux, macOS)">
        ```bash
        sudo (dkp-)pacman -S devkitARM-gdb devkitA64-gdb
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
