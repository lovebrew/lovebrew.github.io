# Gamepad Buttons

:::info

For a list of button names, please see [the official LÖVE wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/GamepadButton).

:::

When using LÖVE Potion on your console, you'll find that the buttons are mapped identically to what you would expect for LÖVE's controller mappings. This ensures a seamless transition and consistent experience for developers familiar with LÖVE.

## Console Button Mappings

The button mappings on your console are designed to mirror the standard controller mappings used in LÖVE. This means that the standard ABXY, D-Pad, Start/Select, and L/R are mapped accordingly. Furthermore, the ZL and ZR buttons (when present) are mapped to the left and right triggers and only output either zero or one. Additionally, the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con, Pro Controller, Wii U Gamepad and Pro Controller all have access to stick pressing.
