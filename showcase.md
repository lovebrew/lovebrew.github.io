### LoveStory
#### by **Shrike**

[LoveStory](https://shrikey.itch.io/lovestory) is a Visual Novel library for LÖVE Potion on the Nintendo Switch. LoveStory’s purpose is to simplify the creation of Visual Novels as well as the integration of a simple to use Dialogue System for story driven games for Nintendo Switch.

To write your own Visual Novels I recommend to download the demo-game and edit novel.lua to your needs. You can find a full documentation of how to use LoveStory in the LoveStory Documentation PDF on the itch.io page.
