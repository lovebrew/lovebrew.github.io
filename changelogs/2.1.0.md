# 2.1.0

### Release Date: TBD

#### Changes from 1.1.0

## Bugfixes
### General
- Fixed "fused" games causing errors
  - Fused games are now just the typical *.love file appended to the *.3dsx or *.nro binary
  - The best way to use custom metadata is via LÖVEBrew
- Fixed Canvas objects not working as they should

### 3DS
- Fixed several graphics primitives from being rendered properly
  - This along with graphical transformations
- Fixed `joystick:isGamepadDown` to fire repeatedly, rather than only once
- Fixed/mitigated a buffer overflow error with requiring files that don't exist

## Modifications

### 3DS
- Renamed `love.graphics.getStereoscopicDepth` to `love.graphics.get3DDepth`
- `love.graphics.getScreens` will return the 3D-enabled or disabled screen names
  - Enabled: "left", "right", "bottom"
  - Disabled: "top", "bottom"

## Additions

### General
- Added `love.system.getFriendCode()`

### 3DS
- Added `love.graphics.set3D(enable)` to enable/disable 3D depth rendering
- Added `love.graphics.get3D()` to return whether or not 3D depth is enabled
